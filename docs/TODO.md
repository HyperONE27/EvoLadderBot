## PRE-ALPHA

- Command guard:
  - ✅ Fully decoupled command guarding errors from frontend
- Matchmaking:
  - ⏰ Fill out the full cross-table for 16 regions
  - ⏰ Get the matchmaker to correctly assign server based on the cross-table
  - ✅ Add more information/clean up existing information on the match found embed
  - ✅ Matchmaker now assigns matches in waves occurring every 45 seconds, up from 5, trading time for fairer matches
  - ✅ Expanding MMR window for matchmaking scales dynamically with active player count and proportion of active player count 
  - ✅ 99 race conditions on the wall, 99 race conditions, take one down, pass it around, 157 race conditions on the wall...
  - ✅ Forbid queueing while a match is active, or queueing again while already queueing.
  - ✅ Consolidated management of QueueSearchingView locks into a single class
  - ⏰ FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE LOW PING MATCHING WITH FAIREST MMR MATCHING
    - High MMR/top competitive players are used to playing across oceans and continents
    - Low MMR players just want to not fight the game
    - Tune the matchmaker to prefer low ping at lower MMR at expense of MMR fairness? Default to strict MMR fairness higher up??? Is this fair?
- Match reporting:
  - ✅ Make the match reporting pipeline more robust
  - ✅ Fix race conditions resulting in the first player to report match result not getting any updates
  - ✅ Add replay uploading and storage to the database (no automatic parsing for now)
  - ✅ Fix some lag associated with both players receiving confirmation of match results
  - ✅ Fix the main embed being overwritten with an error embed when players report disagreeing match results
  - ✅ Add an option to abort 3 matches a month. Aborting matches causes no MMR change.
    - ✅ Exceeding this count and throwing games/smurfing will result in bans.
  - ✅ Fix the display of remaining abortions to players
  - ✅ Match completion on backend is properly abstracted away from frontend
  - ✅ Consolidated management of MatchFoundView locks into a single class
- MMR:
  - ✅ MMR is now ELO-like rather than classic ELO spec-compliant (divisor = 500 rather than 400; 100-point gap predicts a 62-38 win chance instead of 64-36)
  - ✅ MMR is now integer-based rather than float-based
  - ✅ MMR curve now more closely resembles that of Brood War
- Leaderboards:
  - ✅ Add dynamic rank calculations (S/A/B/C/D/E/F) to leaderboard and player profiles
  - ✅ Add rank filter toggling
  - ✅ Edit and add rank emotes
- Account config:
  - ⏰ Update Terms of Service for closed alpha/open beta stage
  - ✅ Fix country setup descriptions for XX (nonrepresenting) / ZZ (other)
  - ✅ /setup persists pre-existing values as defaults (so you don't have to fill them all out again to change one thing)
  - ✅ nulling of alt names is properly recorded in action logs table
  - ✅ Add a /profile page to view one's own MMRs and settings
  - ✅ Add flag emojis to country dropdowns in /setup (including XX and ZZ custom emotes)
  - ✅ Add flag emojis to /setcountry confirmation embeds
- Replays:
  - ✅ Replays are now redirected to storage instead of being stored directly in tables
  - ✅ Tables now store replay paths
  - ✅ Move replays to a dedicated table and add pointer logic between tables
  - ✅ Parse replays for basic info: players, player races, observers, map, timestamp, length, etc.
  - ✅ Send a message to the user with this information when they upload a replay
  - ❌ Update the MatchFoundViewEmbed with this information
    - ✅ Send a new embed message with this information
- Scaling
  - ✅ Define PostgreSQL schema
  - ✅ Full migrate to PostgreSQL
    - ✅ Hybrid architecture with SQLAlchemy adapter allows local testing with SQLite and remote host testing with PostgresSQL
  - ✅ Store replays in separate persistent storage and not in SQL tables
  - ✅ Optimize the shit out of PostgreSQL queries
    - ✅ Bundle queries
    - ✅ Change query types
  - ✅ Implement spawning helper processes for replay parsing (multiprocessing with ProcessPoolExecutor)
    - ✅ Created parse_replay_data_blocking() worker function
    - ✅ Implemented global process pool with configurable workers
    - ✅ Updated on_message() to use run_in_executor()
    - ✅ Comprehensive test suite (6/6 tests passing)
    - ✅ Full documentation and demonstration scripts
  - ✅ Implement service locator pattern for global service instances
- Activation
  - ⏰ De-activate the outdated /activation command
- Admin stuff:
  - ⏰ Add automatic logging/pinging of admins when a match disagreement arises
    - ⏰ Send replay data to admins
  - ⏰ Add an interface to allow admins to view conflicts in matches and resolve with 1 click
