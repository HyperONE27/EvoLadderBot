### Admin & Monitoring

  - ✅ Proper removal from tracking dictionaries (MatchFoundViewManager, channel_to_match_view_map)
  - ✅ Break circular references with `clear_items()` to enable garbage collection
  - ✅ Added telemetry tracking for leaked instances (RSS, view counts, GC metrics)
  - ✅ Expected: Reduce 12h memory growth from 1GB to <150MB (90-95% improvement)
- ✅ 99%+ performance improvement across all critical operations
  - ✅ Rank lookup: 280-316ms → 0.00ms (99.9% improvement)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- ✅ Leaderboard ranks: Fixed missing rank calculations and display
- ✅ Match result calculation: Corrected player report interpretation (0=draw, 1=P1 wins, 2=P2 wins)
- ✅ Abort flow: Fixed "Aborted by Unknown", queue lock releases, and race conditions
- ✅ Replay database writes: Fixed missing uploaded_at field and replay update handlers
- ✅ MMR updates: Fixed in-memory MMR updates and frontend display
- ✅ Player names: Fixed leaderboard displaying "PlayerUnknown" → actual player names
- ✅ Shared replay views: Fixed players seeing each other's replay status
- ✅ Graceful shutdown: Fixed event loop conflicts and task cancellation
- ✅ Error handling: Removed all fallback values, promoting explicit error handling
- ✅ Database consistency: Fixed schema mismatches and missing field handlers

### Database & Infrastructure
- ✅ Define PostgreSQL schema
- ✅ Full migrate to PostgreSQL
  - ✅ Hybrid architecture with SQLAlchemy adapter allows local testing with SQLite and remote host testing with PostgresSQL
- ✅ Store replays in separate persistent storage and not in SQL tables
- ✅ Optimize the shit out of PostgreSQL queries
  - ✅ Bundle queries
  - ✅ Change query types
- ✅ Implement spawning helper processes for replay parsing (multiprocessing with ProcessPoolExecutor)
  - ✅ Created parse_replay_data_blocking() worker function
  - ✅ Implemented global process pool with configurable workers
  - ✅ Updated on_message() to use run_in_executor()
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite (6/6 tests passing)
  - ✅ Full documentation and demonstration scripts
- ✅ Implement service locator pattern for global service instances
- ✅ Migrate timestamps from TIMESTAMP to TIMESTAMPZ with explicit UTC declaration
  - ✅ Source-internal architecture continues to assume UTC

### Legacy Cleanup
- ✅ De-activate the outdated /activation command

### Matchmaking & Match Flow
- ✅ Fill out the full cross-table for 16 regions
- ✅ Get the matchmaker to correctly assign server based on the cross-table
- ✅ Add more information/clean up existing information on the match found embed
- ✅ Matchmaker now assigns matches in waves occurring every 45 seconds, up from 5, trading time for fairer matches
- ✅ Expanding MMR window for matchmaking scales dynamically with active player count and proportion of active player count 
- ✅ 99 race conditions on the wall, 99 race conditions, take one down, pass it around, 157 race conditions on the wall...
- ✅ Forbid queueing while a match is active, or queueing again while already queueing.
- ✅ Consolidated management of QueueSearchingView locks into a single class

### Match Reporting & Completion
- ✅ Make the match reporting pipeline more robust
- ✅ Fix race conditions resulting in the first player to report match result not getting any updates
- ✅ Add replay uploading and storage to the database (no automatic parsing for now)
- ✅ Fix some lag associated with both players receiving confirmation of match results
- ✅ Fix the main embed being overwritten with an error embed when players report disagreeing match results
- ✅ Add an option to abort 3 matches a month. Aborting matches causes no MMR change.
  - ✅ Exceeding this count and throwing games/smurfing will result in bans.
- ✅ Fix the display of remaining abortions to players
- ✅ Match completion on backend is properly abstracted away from frontend
- ✅ Consolidated management of MatchFoundView locks into a single class

### MMR & Ranking System
- ✅ MMR is now ELO-like rather than classic ELO spec-compliant (divisor = 500 rather than 400; 100-point gap predicts a 62-38 win chance instead of 64-36)
- ✅ MMR is now integer-based rather than float-based
- ✅ MMR curve now more closely resembles that of Brood War
- ✅ Add dynamic rank calculations (S/A/B/C/D/E/F) to leaderboard and player profiles
- ✅ Add rank filter toggling
- ✅ Edit and add rank emotes

### Replay System
- ✅ Replays are now redirected to storage instead of being stored directly in tables
- ✅ Tables now store replay paths
- ✅ Move replays to a dedicated table and add pointer logic between tables
- ✅ Parse replays for basic info: players, player races, observers, map, timestamp, length, etc.
- ✅ Send a message to the user with this information when they upload a replay
- ❌ Update the MatchFoundViewEmbed with this information
  - ✅ Send a new embed message with this information
- ✅ Check that uploaded replays comply with the match parameters
  - ✅ Throw a warning if the map link do not match exactly
  - ❌ Reject the replay outright if the wrong races are present

### System Hardening & Optimization
- ✅ No 60-second leaderboard refresh loop, invalidate cache specifically only when services modify MMR
- ✅ Remove synchronous leaderboard path (async path should not fall back to it)
- ❌ Implement a smarter prune protection algorithm than using string matching
  - ✅ Still using string matching but it's less stupid now
- ❓ Implement frontend mock testing
  - ✅ Characterization/regression tests including simulation of frontend flows but not true UI mocking

### User Interface & Commands
- ✅ Command guard: Fully decoupled command guarding errors from frontend
- ✅ Add a /profile page to view one's own MMRs and settings
- ✅ Add flag emojis to country dropdowns in /setup (including XX and ZZ custom emotes)
- ✅ Add flag emojis to /setcountry confirmation embeds
- ❌ Implement action deferral? And add loading bars + disable UI while waiting
  - ✅ Removed all action deferral, since the bot is now so fast that deferral hurts UX

### MORE RANDOM BUGS???
- ✅ Accepting ToS does not properly record having accepted (FIXED)
