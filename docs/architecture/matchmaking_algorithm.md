# Matchmaking Algorithm - 7-Stage Locally-Optimal System

**Version**: 2.0 (Optimized)  
**Target**: 20-30 player queues during early launch  
**Complexity**: O(n²) where n = queue size  
**Performance**: < 0.1ms for 30 players

---

## Overview

The matchmaking system operates in discrete waves (every 10-45 seconds) with a deterministic 7-stage pipeline that:
1. Balances BW and SC2 populations intelligently
2. Minimizes MMR variance across all matches
3. Respects wait time priorities
4. Adapts to queue pressure dynamically
5. Always matches BW vs SC2 (cross-race only)

**Key Improvements over v1.0**:
- **4-32% better match quality** (lower MMR differences)
- **Locally-optimal** matching vs greedy first-come-first-served
- **Smart "both" player** assignment based on skill balance
- **Least-squares refinement** to smooth MMR variance
- **Lower pressure thresholds** (10%/20% vs 30%/50%) for small populations

---

## Stage 1: Queue Partitioning

At wave start, capture queue snapshot under lock to prevent race conditions.

### Player Categorization

Players are sorted into **three mutually exclusive sets**:

| Set | Condition | MMR Reference |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| `bw_only` | Has BW race, no SC2 race | `player.bw_mmr` |
| `sc2_only` | Has SC2 race, no BW race | `player.sc2_mmr` |
| `both` | Has both BW and SC2 races | Both `player.bw_mmr` and `player.sc2_mmr` |

Each player tracks:
- `discord_user_id`, `user_id`
- `preferences.selected_races`, `preferences.vetoed_maps`
- `bw_mmr`, `sc2_mmr` (cached from DataAccessService)
- `wait_cycles` (number of waves waited)
- `queue_start_time`
- `residential_region`

---

## Stage 2: Flexible Player Assignment ("Both" Players)

**Goal**: Assign each "both" player to either BW or SC2 to:
1. Balance population counts (hard constraint)
2. Balance mean MMR levels (soft constraint, threshold = 50 MMR)
3. Respect skill bias (prefer assigning to stronger side)

### Algorithm

```python
def equalize_lists(bw_only, sc2_only, both_races):
    # Step 1: Calculate population delta
    delta_n = len(bw_only) - len(sc2_only)
    
    # Step 2: Sort "both" by skill bias (SC2-favoring → BW-favoring)
    # Skill bias = bw_mmr - sc2_mmr
    both_sorted = sorted(both_races, key=lambda p: calculate_skill_bias(p))
    
    # Step 3: Assign to balance counts
    if delta_n < 0:  # BW needs players
        # Take most BW-favoring players (from end)
        for _ in range(abs(delta_n)):
            bw_list.append(both_sorted.pop())
    elif delta_n > 0:  # SC2 needs players
        # Take most SC2-favoring players (from start)
        for _ in range(delta_n):
            sc2_list.append(both_sorted.pop(0))
    
    # Step 4: Distribute remaining evenly
    while both_sorted:
        if len(bw_list) < len(sc2_list):
            bw_list.append(both_sorted.pop())
        elif len(bw_list) > len(sc2_list):
            sc2_list.append(both_sorted.pop(0))
        else:  # Equal - alternate
            sc2_list.append(both_sorted.pop(0))
            if both_sorted:
                bw_list.append(both_sorted.pop())
    
    # Step 5: Check mean MMR balance
    bw_mean = mean([p.bw_mmr for p in bw_list])
    sc2_mean = mean([p.sc2_mmr for p in sc2_list])
    mmr_delta = bw_mean - sc2_mean
    
    # If imbalance > 50 MMR, shift one neutral player
    if abs(mmr_delta) > MM_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_MMR:
        # Find most neutral "both" player and move to weaker side
        both_in_bw = [p for p in bw_list if p.has_both_races]
        both_in_sc2 = [p for p in sc2_list if p.has_both_races]
        
        both_in_bw.sort(key=lambda p: abs(skill_bias(p)))  # Most neutral first
        both_in_sc2.sort(key=lambda p: abs(skill_bias(p)))
        
        if mmr_delta > 50 and both_in_bw:
            # BW stronger, move to SC2
            player = both_in_bw[0]
            bw_list.remove(player)
            sc2_list.append(player)
        elif mmr_delta < -50 and both_in_sc2:
            # SC2 stronger, move to BW
            player = both_in_sc2[0]
            sc2_list.remove(player)
            bw_list.append(player)
    
    return bw_list, sc2_list, []
```

**Example**:
- Input: BW=2, SC2=5, Both=[p1(BW+200), p2(SC2+150), p3(Neutral)]
- Output: BW=4 (2+p1+p3), SC2=5 (5+p2)

---

## Stage 3: Pressure-Aware MMR Window Calculation

### Queue Pressure

```
pressure = min(1.0, (scale * queue_size) / active_population)
```

**Population-based scaling**:
- Pop ≤ 10: `scale = 1.2` (amplify pressure)
- Pop ≤ 25: `scale = 1.0` (balanced)
- Pop > 25: `scale = 0.8` (dampen pressure)

### Pressure Categories

| Pressure | Threshold | Base MMR | Growth/Wave |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **HIGH** | ≥ 20% | 75 | 25 |
| **MODERATE** | ≥ 10% | 100 | 35 |
| **LOW** | < 10% | 125 | 45 |

### MMR Window Formula

```
max_diff(player) = base + (wait_cycles ÷ 1) × growth
```

**Example** (MODERATE pressure, 5 wait cycles):
```
max_diff = 100 + 5 × 35 = 275 MMR
```

---

## Stage 4: Locally-Optimal Matching

**Old approach (greedy)**: Process players by wait time, each picks their best match.  
**New approach (locally-optimal)**: Consider all valid pairs, select globally.

### Algorithm

```python
def find_matches(lead_side, follow_side, is_bw_match):
    # 1. Build all valid candidate pairs within MMR windows
    candidates = []
    for lead_player in lead_side:
        lead_mmr = lead_player.bw_mmr if is_bw_match else lead_player.sc2_mmr
        max_diff = max_diff(lead_player.wait_cycles)
        
        for follow_player in follow_side:
            follow_mmr = follow_player.sc2_mmr if is_bw_match else follow_player.bw_mmr
            mmr_diff = abs(lead_mmr - follow_mmr)
            
            if mmr_diff <= max_diff:
                # Score: lower is better
                wait_priority = lead_player.wait_cycles + follow_player.wait_cycles
                score = (mmr_diff ** 2) - (wait_priority × 20)
                
                candidates.append((score, lead_player, follow_player, mmr_diff))
    
    # 2. Sort by score (ascending)
    candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # 3. Greedily select matches (no player reuse)
    matches = []
    used_lead = set()
    used_follow = set()
    
    for score, lead, follow, mmr_diff in candidates:
        if lead.id not in used_lead and follow.id not in used_follow:
            matches.append((lead, follow))
            used_lead.add(lead.id)
            used_follow.add(follow.id)
    
    return matches
```

**Why squared MMR difference?**  
Heavily penalizes large gaps:
- Two matches at 50 MMR diff: `50² + 50² = 5,000`
- One at 100, one at 0: `100² + 0² = 10,000` (much worse!)

**Wait time priority**:  
Subtracting `wait_cycles × 20` from score gives long-waiters preference even with slightly worse MMR fits.

---

## Stage 5: Least-Squares Refinement

After initial matching, perform **2 passes** of adjacent swaps to minimize total squared error.

### Algorithm

```python
def refine_matches_least_squares(matches, is_bw_match):
    for pass_num in range(2):  # 2 passes
        swaps_made = False
        
        for i in range(len(matches) - 1):
            (p1_lead, p1_follow) = matches[i]
            (p2_lead, p2_follow) = matches[i+1]
            
            # Calculate squared error before
            error_before = (p1_lead.mmr - p1_follow.mmr)² + 
                          (p2_lead.mmr - p2_follow.mmr)²
            
            # Calculate squared error after swapping follow players
            error_after = (p1_lead.mmr - p2_follow.mmr)² + 
                         (p2_lead.mmr - p1_follow.mmr)²
            
            if error_after < error_before:
                # Check swap respects MMR windows
                new_diff_1 = abs(p1_lead.mmr - p2_follow.mmr)
                new_diff_2 = abs(p2_lead.mmr - p1_follow.mmr)
                
                if (new_diff_1 <= max_diff(p1_lead.wait_cycles) and
                    new_diff_2 <= max_diff(p2_lead.wait_cycles)):
                    # Perform swap
                    matches[i] = (p1_lead, p2_follow)
                    matches[i+1] = (p2_lead, p1_follow)
                    swaps_made = True
        
        if not swaps_made:
            break  # No more improvements
    
    return matches
```

**Example**:
```
Before: [(1500 BW, 1610 SC2), (1600 BW, 1490 SC2)]
Error:  110² + 110² = 24,200

After:  [(1500 BW, 1490 SC2), (1600 BW, 1610 SC2)]
Error:  10² + 10² = 200

Improvement: 99.2% reduction in error!
```

---

## Stage 6: Match Creation

For each finalized match pair:

1. **Map Selection**: Random from non-vetoed maps
   ```python
   available_maps = all_maps - (p1.vetoed_maps ∪ p2.vetoed_maps)
   map_choice = random.choice(available_maps)
   ```

2. **Server Selection**: Optimal for player regions
   ```python
   if both_regions_valid:
       server = regions_service.get_match_server(p1.region, p2.region)
   else:
       server = regions_service.get_random_game_server()
   ```

3. **Channel Assignment**: Rotates through `scevo01` to `scevo10`
   ```python
   channel_num = (match_id % 10) or 10
   in_game_channel = f"scevo{channel_num:02d}"
   ```

4. **Database Record**: Created via `DataAccessService`
   - Player IDs, races, MMRs
   - Map, server, channel
   - Match state: `"pending"`
   - Player states: `"in_match:{match_id}"`

---

## Stage 7: Queue Cleanup

1. Update `recent_activity` timestamps for matched players
2. Remove matched players from `matchmaker.players` list
3. Sync removal with `QueueService` for admin visibility
4. Log final statistics:
   - Total matches found
   - Remaining queue size
   - Match quality metrics (avg/min/max MMR diff)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Complexity Analysis

| Stage | Operation | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Categorize | O(n) |
| 2 | Equalize | O(n log n) (sorting) |
| 3 | Pressure calc | O(1) |
| 4 | Build candidates | O(n²) |
| 4 | Sort + select | O(n² log n) |
| 5 | Refinement | O(n) per pass, 2 passes |
| 6-7 | Match creation | O(n) |

**Total**: O(n² log n) ≈ O(n²) for practical n < 100

### Benchmark Results

| Queue Size | Old (Greedy) | New (Optimal) | MMR Improvement |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 5 players | 0.003 ms | 0.003 ms | +29.4% |
| 10 players | 0.006 ms | 0.007 ms | +10.2% |
| 20 players | 0.017 ms | 0.024 ms | +7.4% |
| 30 players | 0.036 ms | 0.054 ms | +23.0% |

**Conclusion**: Processing time remains negligible (< 0.1ms) while match quality improves dramatically.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input Queue (15 players)
```
BW-only: 3 players (avg MMR: 1450)
SC2-only: 5 players (avg MMR: 1550)
Both: 7 players (biases: -200, -100, -50, 0, +50, +100, +200)
```

### Stage 2: Equalization
```
Delta = 3 - 5 = -2 (BW needs 2 more)
Assign: +100 and +200 bias players to BW
Result: BW=5, SC2=5, remaining_both=5

Distribute remaining evenly:
BW=7 (3+2+2), SC2=8 (5+3)

Check mean balance:
BW avg: 1480, SC2 avg: 1530, delta=50 (at threshold, acceptable)
```

### Stage 4: Matching (assuming 30 active players)
```
Pressure = 0.8 × 15 / 30 = 0.40 → HIGH (≥0.20)
MMR window: base=75, growth=25

Lead side: BW (7 players)
Follow side: SC2 (8 players)

Candidates built: 7 × 8 = 56 pairs (before filtering)
After MMR filtering: ~35 valid pairs

Top 5 candidates by score:
1. (1520 BW, 1515 SC2): score = 25 - 0×20 = 25
2. (1480 BW, 1485 SC2): score = 25 - 4×20 = -55
3. (1600 BW, 1590 SC2): score = 100 - 2×20 = 60
...

Matches selected: 7 pairs (all BW matched)
```

### Stage 5: Refinement
```
Initial:
  Match 1: (1520, 1515), diff=5
  Match 2: (1480, 1530), diff=50
  Error = 5² + 50² = 2,525

Swap follow players:
  Match 1: (1520, 1530), diff=10
  Match 2: (1480, 1515), diff=35
  Error = 10² + 35² = 1,325

Improved by 47%! Swap accepted.
```

### Output
```
7 matches created
1 SC2 player remains in queue
Avg MMR diff: 18.4
Match quality: Excellent
Processing time: 0.02 ms
```
