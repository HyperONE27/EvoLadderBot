CHANGES NEEDED:

1. Line 246: Change __init__ signature to accept state parameters
2. Lines 254-259: Use parameters instead of hardcoded defaults
3. Line 287-294: Pass state to LeaderboardView() instead of copying after

This will ensure UI components are created with the correct selected/pressed state.
